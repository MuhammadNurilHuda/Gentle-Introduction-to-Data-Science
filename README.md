# Gentle Introduction to Data Science

This is a Gentle Tutorial to be a good Data Scientist (although it's not too gentle, and also i'm not a Data Scientist yet LOL). This repo isn't finished yet. Reach me on email or LinkedIn for suggestions !!! I highly appreciated all suggestions.


The materials include:
1.  Python
2.  Data Structure
3.  Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib
4.  Statistics (it's also kinda hard for me)
5.  ML
6.  MLOps
